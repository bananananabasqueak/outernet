## Lightning Talk

**Some quick reminders:**

* 3-5 minutes
* Can be done with slides or no slides (we'd love to see you try!)
* You will have access to a projecter and/or a whiteboard
* if you need any props, please let us know!

### Plan

> What do you want  to have your lightning talk about? It can be about anything like art to why JSX is bad, as long it's appropriate.
> What would the talk look like? 

I want my lightning talk to be about how programming languages decide if a program is "correct", and how compilers reason about programs.
The talk will be quite abstract and surface-level, but it will hopefully inspire viewers to look into the topic more. This subject is part of something
that I have been passionate about for years, and I love spreading the knowledge I've gotten. Many people see language design and implementation as a sort
of sorcery, and I want to demystify it and make it more accessible to anybody. From having gotten into the subject myself, I found that the resources
on many things is lacking, mostly comprised of research papers, and I don't want you to have to have a P.H.D. to learn how type systems work!

I will go over:
* Dynamically typed, staticallly typed, and gradually typed
  * What do those mean? How does the compiler/interpreter reason about those?
* How a compiler determines that a program is "correct" type-wise
* How a compiler can reason about a program in the first place

I'll have slides, so I'll need a projector.
