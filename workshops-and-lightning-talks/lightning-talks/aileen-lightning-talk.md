## Lightning Talk

I want to talk about my figure skating journey, lessons from the ice, interesting things and facts about this unique art and sport, and some science behind it.


My goal of this lightning talk is to hopefully encourage anyone try out a new sport/hobby/skill/anything that sparks their curiosity, self-growth, and stepping out of their comfort zone! :)

I'm a very visual person so I will project a few slides to show what I'm talking about and provide more info.
