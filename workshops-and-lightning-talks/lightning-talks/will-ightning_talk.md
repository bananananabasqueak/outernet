## Lightning Talk

**Some quick reminders:**

* 3-5 minutes
* Can be done with slides or no slides (we'd love to see you try!)
* You will have access to a projecter and/or a whiteboard
* if you need any props, please let us know!

### Plan

> What do you want  to have your lightning talk about? It can be about anything like art to why JSX is bad, as long it's appropriate.

In my lightning talk I will talk about the Forth programming language and some cool (but valid) forth code.

> What would the talk look like? Mention if you're going to have slides!!

I will have some slides with code segments on them; I will start with an explanation and background of stack oriented languages like forth, and then I will show some interesting code examples that show the power of abstraction that forth provides.
