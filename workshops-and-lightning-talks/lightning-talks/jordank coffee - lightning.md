## Lightning Talk

**Some quick reminders:**

* 3-5 minutes
* Can be done with slides or no slides (we'd love to see you try!)
* You will have access to a projecter and/or a whiteboard
* if you need any props, please let us know!

### Plan

> What do you want  to have your lightning talk about? It can be about anything like art to why JSX is bad, as long it's appropriate.

I plan to do a lightning talk on coffee, why it's great (flavor, energy, and the social aspect it brings) and how to break away from spending so much money on it.

> What would the talk look like? Mention if you're going to have slides!!

Slides showing my dunkins spending habits, photo of the dunkins outside my school, and photo of aeropress.


* Pretty much everyone here understands the impact of coffee, whether you love it or hate it.
* Show off my excessive spending habits on Dunkins.
* Coffee doesn't have to be expensive though. And traditional drip coffee makers don't make great coffee.
* Aeropress + Trader Joes coffee! 15 cents a cup
* Coffee, like coding, music, or camping, is something that brings people together.
* You see coffee shops on every street corner for a reason, it transcends being just a drink, and is a part of modern culture, regardless of where you are.
* Embrace it! It's always great to sit down with a friend and have a conversation over tea, coffee, or hot chocolate!

.. and so forth (you can also write a full paragraph if you'd like).
