## Lightning Talk

**Some quick reminders:**

* 3-5 minutes
* Can be done with slides or no slides (we'd love to see you try!)
* You will have access to a projecter and/or a whiteboard
* if you need any props, please let us know!

### Plan

I would like to disscuss VPNs, the common misconceptions and misleading advertisement surrounding them, and what a VPN really is.

### Slides
- What is the general perception of a VPN?
- Common claims used by VPN companies to advertise and promote VPNs.
- What a VPN actually is
- VPNs don't provide encryption
- They don't provide privacy
- They don't make you safer
