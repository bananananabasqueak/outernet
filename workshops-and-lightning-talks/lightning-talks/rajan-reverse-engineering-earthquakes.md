## Lightning Talk

**Some quick reminders:**

* 3-5 minutes
* Can be done with slides or no slides (we'd love to see you try!)
* You will have access to a projecter and/or a whiteboard
* if you need any props, please let us know!

### Plan

> What do you want  to have your lightning talk about? It can be about anything like art to why JSX is bad, as long it's appropriate.

> What would the talk look like? Mention if you're going to have slides!!

Here's an example: 

* Introduce a project I've been working on for 7 months: Shapeshift
* Discuss intl need for earthquake resistant buildings (Turkey/Syria - my conversations with UNICEF)
* Break down earthquake wave frequencies and how the Fourier Transform can be used to interpret and transform them
* Reveal discovery made with this math and how earthquake decay can be modelled mathematically
* Show machine learning models and how these can be reverse engineered to design buildings that resist in that area
* Talk about policy analysis + geological data that can contribute to building selection
* Reveal how Shapeshift has already been implemented + future plans

I'll need both a projector and a whiteboard!
