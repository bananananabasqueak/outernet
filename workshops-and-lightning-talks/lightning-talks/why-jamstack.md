## Lightning Talk

**Some quick reminders:**

* 3-5 minutes
* Can be done with slides or no slides (we'd love to see you try!)
* You will have access to a projecter and/or a whiteboard
* if you need any props, please let us know!

### Plan

> What do you want to have your lightning talk about? It can be about anything like art to why JSX is bad, as long it's appropriate.

> What would the talk look like? Mention if you're going to have slides!!
* I want to talk about why Jamstack is one of the best approaches for architecture, compared to a dynamic website
* I want to explain that Jamstack isn't a set technology, rather a philosophy designed to make your websites better
* Some people think that Jamstack is just a bunch of HTML files without any data fetching or any templates, and I wish to explain that isn't true
* I can also explain why Jamstack sites can be setup to load faster than most dynamic sites, how they can save money, and require less maintenance
* I will show some code examples and show some benchmarks
* I will also show surveys from other developers
* I will also show alternatives to many CMSes (like WordPress)
* I will use slides and would like to use a projector, please :)
<!--
Here's an example: 

* I want to talk about why tabs are better than spaces
* Show them the difference of tabs and spaces
* I'll give extreme and funny examples
* I will show code and use a clip from the internet
* I will have slides and need a projecter

.. and so forth (you can also write a full paragraph if you'd like).
