## Lightning Talk

**Some quick reminders:**

* 3-5 minutes
* Can be done with slides or no slides (we'd love to see you try!)
* You will have access to a projecter and/or a whiteboard
* if you need any props, please let us know!

### Plan

> What do you want  to have your lightning talk about? It can be about anything like art to why JSX is bad, as long it's appropriate.

My talk will be about the Internet Layer of the Internet Protocol, specifically on ICMP requests and how I pinged the entire (IPv4) internet while creating [wPing](https://github.com/NalinPlad/wPing). I would go over my idea, what ICMP is, and how I actually wrote the programs.
> What would the talk look like? Mention if you're going to have slides!!

It would be similar to my QR Code talk at assemble, lots of visuals, with slides that have explanations.
