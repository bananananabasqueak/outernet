## Lightning Talk

**Some quick reminders:**

* 3-5 minutes
* Can be done with slides or no slides (we'd love to see you try!)
* You will have access to a projecter and/or a whiteboard
* if you need any props, please let us know!

### Plan

> What do you want  to have your lightning talk about? It can be about anything like art to why JSX is bad, as long it's appropriate.

> What would the talk look like? Mention if you're going to have slides!!

I want to talk about how America ended up with car-dependent sprawl everywhere outside of a few major areas. How GM bought up tram networks to kill them, and all the propaganda they did. I definately want to have slides
