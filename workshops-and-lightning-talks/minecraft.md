## Lightning Talk

### Plan

* I want to talk about my personal story for how Minecraft influenced me
* Outline the characteristics of Minecraft from a Design POV
* Share how those characteristics have spread into mainstream tech products
* Define what it means to be a hacker
* Tie together how being a hacker aligns with the shared experience of Minecraft
