## OOP with Java and Intro to Functional Programming
*This could also be done with Python if they wanted to create a game with Pygame

### Plan

> What do you want to run, and how do you think it'll be like? (can you give us a rough outline?)

Teach people the basics of Java, such as syntax and basic types, along with object-oriented programming by having them code along to a small project. Then they can try to make their own simple project using objects, possibly in groups depending on how many people there are. I think this will go pretty well and they can help each other or I could guide them if they get stuck. Once they have a good idea of what OOP is, we can talk about what functional programming is and how it differs from OOP. We probably won't learn any languages because they are harder to learn but we can write "functional programming" code in Java by rewriting our original project to see how it differs.
 
> Are there any resources you think you might use? Have you run something like this before, or have an example (even if it's not related 100%)

We will definitely need some way to write/run Java programs, probably a cache of vs code and OpenJDK on the network or just use an online Java compiler at one of the AP with internet. I am basing this loosely on what my intro to Java class did when they were teaching new topics because it seemed to work out pretty well.

*we would need Python 3.x and the Pygame library if they wanted to learn Python instead of Java  

### Outline

1. Get Java set up on the computers or open an online editor
2. Create/Open a new file
3. Explain the main function and create a hello world script
4. add variables and go over the basic types
5. learn OOP with a small project (I still need to come up with a good project)
    1. learn what a class is and its function and what methods and attributes do
    2. write chunks or lines of code/sudo-code and explain what they do in the project
    3. let them tinker with it a little/ create their own project so they can better understand it
6. teach them the basics of functional programming (keeping data and methods separate and having methods that return the same thing for a given input)
7. have them try to rewrite the original project with functional principals
8. go over the differences between the two and their use cases

### Do you think you might need anything?

> Do you need hardware boards, or other supplies like paint that you would need us to purchase or have on hand? We won't have any projectors available.

* Whiteboard and markers

just me
