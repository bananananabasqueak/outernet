## Workshop name

### Plan (Tentative)

> What do you want to run, and how do you think it'll be like? (can you give us a rough outline?)

The aim of this workshop is to introduce high school students to the basics of Neural Networks and PyTorch, a popular machine-learning framework. By the end of the workshop, participants should be able to build a simple image classification neural network that can recognize handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset.

> Are there any resources you think you might use? Have you run something like this before, or have an example (even if it's not related 100%)

I ran this workshop at [Assemble](https://github.com/emilyjiayaoli/HoloTicTacToe) last year. Neural network wise I have trained much more complicated models before so this should be straightforward.

#### Outline

1. Participants will open [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) on their computers. This platform provides free GPU resources and comes with PyTorch pre-installed.
2. I will start by introducing the concept of neural networks, their architecture, and how they learn patterns from data.
3. Next, I will provide an overview of PyTorch and its utility in the AI/ML community.
4. I will guide participants through the process of loading and visualizing the MNIST dataset using PyTorch's built-in functionalities.
5. I will explain the process of creating a simple neural network architecture using PyTorch.
6. I will demonstrate how to train the model using the training data, explaining the concept of backpropagation, loss functions, and optimizers.
7. Participants will learn how to evaluate the model's performance on the test data.
8. Finally, I will wrap-up the workshop, address any questions, and provide resources for further learning.


### Do you think you might need anything?
Perhaps a GPU to accelerate training or probably Google Colab (so access to the internet). If we don't have internet access, I could modify the workshop to build something form scratch.

### People involved

> Just me for now!
