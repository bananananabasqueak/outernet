## Build your own Virtual DOM

### Plan

Running a workshop to build a virtual DOM ([slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1sDGpFU6nyBbDJjTfHsjq77pcCX6s72xXwlGe6QIG14A/edit?usp=sharing))

#### Outline

For example:

1. Go through conceptual overview of virtual (why, what, how?)
2. Build virtual DOM, step by step via a repl.it
3. Review what we did, next steps and possible extensions
