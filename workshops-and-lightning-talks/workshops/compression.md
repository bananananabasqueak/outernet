## Workshop name

### Plan

> What do you want to run, and how do you think it'll be like? (can you give us a rough outline?)

> Are there any resources you think you might use? Have you run something like this before, or have an example (even if it's not related 100%)

#### Outline

For example:

1. Break down how the fourier transform works
2. Demonstrate how different file systems can be demonstrated as a series of waves
3. Talk about the fourier series and how these waves can be demonstrated as a sum of sinusoidal waves
4. Show on the piano the different frequencies and how they can identify different waves
5. Play pieces and show how each wave frequency can be summed up through music to reconstruct initial wave
6. Let individuals use the piano to reconstruct initial pieces of information and identify lossless content
7. (Mostly have fun on the piano :))

### Do you think you might need anything?

> Do you need hardware boards, or other supplies like paint that you would need us to purchase or have on hand? We won't have any projectors available.

- Whiteboard
- Piano, if possible. If not, it's fine but I'll need to change up the approach for the workshop

### People involved

> List all the people who are running this workshop if it's more than 1!

For example: Just me!
