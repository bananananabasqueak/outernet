## Version Control with Git

### Plan

I want to run a workshop to introduce people to the idea of version control with git and how it can be used to make collaboration easier. I think it'll be cool to use the whiteboard to illustrate how branches and the tree structure works. I've run several workshops at a hackclub at my school and at a hackathon, and I think this should be pretty similar to those.

#### Outline

1. Why do you need version control?
2. Introduce git and it's background (who made it? why?, etc.)
3. Introduce the branch structure and how it works (master, branches, snapshots, etc.)
4. Introduce the idea of local and remote repositories (how this makes collobration easier)
5. Introduce the basic git commands (add, commit, push, pull, etc.)
6. Let people try it out on their own machines!

### Do you think you might need anything?
