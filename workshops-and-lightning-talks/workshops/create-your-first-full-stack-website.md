## Build your first full-stack website!

### Plan
An interactive workshop where people create their own personal website + a guestbook built with Supabase!

I've built something very similar before + a personal website template called Conifer.

#### Outline

For example:

1. Fork and set up the Conifer example.
2. Collect credentials - such as API keys.
3. Show them how to set up the code step by step!

### Do you think you might need anything?

I don't think so!
