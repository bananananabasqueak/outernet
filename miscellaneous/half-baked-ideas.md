# Half-Baked Ideas

Core experiences:
- goal setting around campfires conversations
- having a win (/project built) in a technical area that is hard to access (like having an incredible rust workshop or having a PCB mill on hand where people can build their own circuits)
- being able to bring ThingTM into space, other people add to ThingTM, bring ThingTM back as a momento
- Retro Tech, a meet of the old and the new (Beta John)

Vibe:
- weird and insane thing that i've been trying to do but here's finally a space for me to do it, and have other people contribute to it 

Potential ideas: 
- when you enter, you can set your own goals (to set the expectation that you build your own experience) — example, a big screen that shows everyone's goals and the only way to add it is to punch your card in a machine
- lots of sports and just fun experiences
